  Download latest Blynk library here:
    https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/releases/latest

  Blynk is a platform with iOS and Android apps to control
  Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the likes over the Internet.
  You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your
  projects by simply dragging and dropping widgets.

  This example code is in public domain.

 *************************************************************
  For this example you need UIPEthernet library:
    https://github.com/UIPEthernet/UIPEthernet

  Typical wiring would be:
   VCC -- 5V
   GND -- GND
   CS  -- D10
   SI  -- D11
   SCK -- D13
   SO  -- D12
   INT -- D2

  Youâ€™ll need:
   - Blynk App (download from AppStore or Google Play)
   - Arduino Uno board
   - Decide how to connect to Blynk
     (USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ...)

  There is a bunch of great example sketches included to show you how to get
  started. Think of them as LEGO bricks  and combine them as you wish.
  For example, take the Ethernet Shield sketch and combine it with the
  Servo example, or choose a USB sketch and add a code from SendData
  example.

  // You can inject your own code or combine it with other sketches.
